In this Tableau project, a comprehensive sales dataset containing customer details, product information, dates, and geographical locations was analyzed to uncover key business insights. The data preprocessing phase was performed using PostgreSQL, where unnecessary columns were removed, data types were adjusted, and join operations were applied to consolidate relevant tables, streamlining the dataset for analysis. Once cleaned, Tableau’s robust features were used to create multiple visualizations: bar charts to highlight the top 10 customers and products, line charts to compare budget vs. actual sales, and map charts to visualize sales by country and state. A pie chart was also created to analyze product categories versus sales amounts. Essential Tableau functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), RANK(), WINDOW_SUM(), and Z-Score were applied to derive insights on total sales, averages, and ranking, helping to measure performance across different segments. Features such as "Filters," "Groups," and "Sets" were used to segment the data for more detailed analysis, while "Calculated Fields" were employed to create custom metrics and insights based on specific conditions. The "Show Me" feature allowed for easy switching between different chart types to find the most effective visualization for each data set. Finally, an interactive dashboard was designed using Tableau’s "Dashboard" feature, allowing users to explore the data dynamically through filters and drill-down capabilities. This dashboard provided a consolidated view of sales trends, regional performance, and product insights, empowering the team to make informed decisions and optimize business strategies. The integration of these Tableau functions and features ensured that the project was both insightful and actionable, driving informed decision-making.
